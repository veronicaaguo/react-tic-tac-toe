Description:
A simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React.
Players take turns placing X and O on a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
After a win or draw, a “Play Again” button appears to reset the board and start a new round.
